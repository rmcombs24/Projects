Mass Media Editor

What's New?

The latest realease has some QoL changes that allow for easier editing. Such as selectable fields for editing. There's also access to the error log from inside of the app.

Upcoming:

So in the upcoming update I plan on having a bit clearer direction as to which sections the fields belong to. The program should mimic which fields belong to which section(s) in the file details. This may or may not include a refactoring to the underlying classes, as well as more updates to the edit-ui.

Description:

Mass Media Editor is a tool that it used for editing metadata on Media files in windows. Now you will be able to organize multiple files at a time instead of having to do it manually.
