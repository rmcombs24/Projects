Mass Media Editor

What's New?

So in the latest relase the edit ui has been updated. Now instead of a drop down for each field data is now presented in a more friendly data layout.

Upcoming:

So in the upcoming updates I am hoping to add field select. So that the end-user can select which fields they want instead of having all of them at once. There will also be an update that adds easier access to the error log from the UI instead of having to navigate to it manually.

Description:

Mass Media Editor is a tool that it used for editing metadata on Media files in windows. Now you will be able to organize multiple files at a time instead of having to do it manually.
